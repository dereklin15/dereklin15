  <h2> About Me</h2> <br/>
  Hello World, my name is Derek Lin and this is my Github profile. This is a place to get to know me better and show more of what I stand for and my capabilities. Core Values: POLISHED, THOUGHTFUL, ENTHUSIASTIC

My career started after graduating from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a B.S. in Travel Industry Management. I was able to excel in the hospitality industry and received management promotions operating one of the largest hotels in Hawaii, the Sheraton Waikiki. I gained copious skills and experience through my time there such as being Chamption of the Upsell Program and increasing upsell revenue by an average of 9.1% from 2016-2018 YOY, led hotel operations through the LOCAL 5 UNITE HERE 52-day union labor disruption, training and hiring 3 Guest Service Managers and 7 Guest Service Representatives, and managing staff and operations through a $250+ million full room renovation. These projects and experiences I encountered shaped my leadership style. Since hospitality is a people person business, I am THOUGHTFUL in all that I do and I care for others when making decisions for the future.

The COVID19 pandemic greatly affected the world with extreme disruption in the hospitality industry. Due to the pandemic, the industry was shut down and it was a challenging time for all. From operating the hotel with limited staff, to closing the hotel for a 7month period, and to reopening the hotel with new and safe policies and procedures, there was much to be gained from the experience. Given that I was able to develop and hone in on my soft skills, I had the desire to learn hard skills and continue to be ENTHUSIASTIC about growth and development in life.

I then pivoted to the more technology side of hospitality, joining Autoclerk INC, Best Western Hotels and Resorts as a IT Technician. Autoclerk is a Hotel Property Management System with over 600+ properties world-wide. As I continued to grow, I became a IT Business Analyst for Best Western Hotels where I was part of a pioneer project team integrating the payment processor Stripe Platform/API for international hotels in compliance to the Payment Services/Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2/SCA) Directive in the European Economic Area (EEA).

I also went through the California State University East Bay Certificate of Cybersecurity Bootcamp powered by Fullstack Academy. This six-month immersive program that developed my skills in advanced red team/blue team skills as well as knowledge in networking and security tools. With completion of the certificate in April 2022, I am now continuing my drive and enthusiasm for growth and development in my career. With my POLISHED experiences both in customer/client relations, leadership, and hard skills in security tools and technology, I am confident in my ability to be a positive asset in my endeavors.

Please enjoy this profile and I would love to connect further!

Mahalo, Derek Lin <br/>
